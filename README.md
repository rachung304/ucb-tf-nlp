# UC Berkeley Tensorflow NLP Project

### Students: Paul Orona, Raymond Chung

## Dependencies:
TensorFlow
Matplotlib.pyplot
numpy
Tensorboard
Python 3.x

## Instructions:

Run the following commands to train the model with input text

'''cd /ucb-tf-nlp
python3 train.py
'''

Running the script will return the input texts split into positive and negative review files, and the accuracy from training the model.

Sample result:

The iterations are set to 100,000 and usual wait time is around 20-30 mins.
The checkpoints will be saved for later on the test runs.
